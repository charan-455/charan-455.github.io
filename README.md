- **Deployment & Optimization**: Model Quantization, AI Porting

## üîß Featured Projects

Here are a few of the projects I‚Äôve worked on:

- #### AI Porting (July 2024 - Present)
Quantizing audio models involves reducing their precision from floating-point to lower-bit representations, such as 8-bit
integers. This process optimizes models for faster, more efficient performance on devices with limited resources, like
smartphones or embedded systems. The trade-off is minimal loss in accuracy with power usage.
- #### Speaker Diarization (May 2024 - July 2024)
Developing a system that can perform speaker diarization, that automatically identify and segment different speakers in
an audio recording. This technique is commonly used in meetings, interviews, and media content to improve the clarity
of who is speaking when. Successfully achieved, Diarization Error Rate (DER) of less than 20.
- #### Background Voice Suppression: (Mar 2024 - May 2024)
Designed a robust models with targeting noise reduction in multi-speaker environments to isolate and enhance the speech
of the primary speaker near the microphone. Implemented algorithms to distinguish and amplify the target speaker‚Äôs
voice amidst various background noises, optimizing for clarity and accuracy in challenging acoustic settings
- #### Multi Variate Noise Suppression: (Jan 2024 - Mar 2024)
Developed and implemented algorithms for noise reduction in complex multivariate conditions. Enhanced speech quality
and accuracy using advanced deep learning and machine learning techniques. Improved signal-to-noise ratio and POLQA
scores, optimizing overall processing efficiency.
- #### Speaker Recognition: (Aug 2023 - Dec 2024)
Proficient in speaker recognition technologies, including both speaker verification and identification. Knowledgeable in
optimizing recognition systems for various environments, minimizing error rates and integration with real time systems.
- #### Keyword Spotting for Indian Languages: (Sep 2022 - Mar 2023)
Developed a system to accurately detect predefined keywords in audio recordings of various Indian languages (Telugu,
Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Bengali) using Kaldi speech processing toolkit.
- #### Automatic Speech Recognition: (Apr 2022 - Sep 2022)
Worked on a robust speech recognition system for Indian (English, Telugu, Hindi) using the Kaldi toolkit.
