# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! I'm **Charan**, a passionate **AI Engineer** with **2.5 years** of hands-on experience specializing in **Audio AI**. I work with cutting-edge machine learning and signal processing techniques to develop intelligent systems that understand and interact with speech data.

## 🚀 About Me

With a strong foundation in **Machine Learning**, **Audio Signal Processing**, and **Deep Learning**, I've had the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects in the **Audio AI** industry. Currently, I’m working at an **Meeaami Audio AI company**, where I’ve been helping build and optimize AI-driven solutions that enhance audio understanding in various domains, from **Speech Recognition** to **Speech Enhancment**.

### Skills & Technologies:
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **Audio Signal Processing**: MFCC, Spectrograms, Feature Extraction
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Deployment & Optimization**: Model Quantization, AI Porting

## 🔧 Featured Projects

Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on:

### [Audio Classification System](link-to-project)
A deep learning-based model that classifies various audio events. This system processes raw audio files, extracts features, and categorizes them into classes such as speech, music, or noise.

### [Speech-to-Text with Deep Learning](link-to-project)
An end-to-end neural network-based system for speech recognition. This project demonstrates my ability to process raw audio data and convert it into accurate transcriptions.

### [Real-time Sound Recognition](link-to-project)
A real-time sound event detection system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify sounds as they happen, enabling applications in smart environments, security, and more.

Feel free to explore these projects, and if you’re interested, don’t hesitate to fork them or open issues to discuss improvements or ideas!
