- #### [GenAI App - AI Code Reviewer](https://github.com/charan-455/GenAI_Internship_Innomatics/tree/main/GenAI_App-AI_Code_Reviewer)
    - GenAI App is a Python-based web application that allows users to submit their code for review.
    - The application provides feedback on potential bugs, errors, and areas for improvement, along with suggestions for fixing the issues. Powered by **Google Gen AI** models and built with **Streamlit**.
    -  This app offers a user-friendly interface for seamless code review.

## üîß Featured Projects Exploratary Data Analysis:

- #### [Data Analysis (EDA) on Electric Vehicle](https://github.com/charan-455/GenAI_Internship_Innomatics/tree/main/EV_EDA_Project)
    - Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate) on the EV dataset
    - Create a **Choropleth** using **plotly.express** to display the number of EV vehicles based on location.
    - Create a **Racing Bar** plot to display the animation of EV's manufactured and its count each year.
      
- #### [Data Analysis (EDA) on the AMEO dataset](https://github.com/charan-455/GenAI_Internship_Innomatics/tree/main/AMCAT_EDA_Project)
    - Analyzed a dataset of 4000 engineering graduates to explore the relationship between salary and job-related factors (titles, locations) alongside cognitive, technical, and personality skills.
    - Performed EDA using Python **(Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to visualize and identify patterns in both continuous and categorical variables.
    - Cleaned and preprocessed data containing 38 features, including demographic and standardized scores, to inform predictive modeling for employment outcomes. 
      
## üîß Featured Projects in Audio and Speech:

- #### AI Porting (Jul 2024 - Nov 2024)
    - Quantizing audio models involves reducing their precision from floating-point to lower-bit representations, such as 8-bit
integers.
    - This process optimizes models for faster, more efficient performance on devices with limited resources, like smartphones or embedded systems. The trade-off is minimal loss in accuracy with power usage.
      
- #### End to End Speech Emotion Recogition (Nov 2024)
    - End to End speech emotion recognition with 7 classes.
    - Trained on Ravdess, Crema, TESS, SAVEE data sets with **95%** test accuracy.  

- #### Background Voice Suppression: (Mar 2024 - May 2024)
    - Designed a robust models with targeting noise reduction in multi-speaker environments to isolate and enhance the speech
of the primary speaker near the microphone.
    - Implemented algorithms to distinguish and amplify the target speaker‚Äôs
voice amidst various background noises, optimizing for clarity and accuracy in challenging acoustic settings.

- #### Multi Variate Noise Suppression: (Jan 2024 - Mar 2024)
    - Developed and implemented algorithms for noise reduction in complex multivariate conditions. Enhanced speech quality
and accuracy using advanced deep learning and machine learning techniques.
    - Improved signal-to-noise ratio and POLQA scores, optimizing overall processing efficiency.
    - 
- ####  Speaker Recognition and Speaker Diarization (May 2024 - Jul 2024)
    - Proficient in speaker recognition technologies, including both speaker verification and identification. Knowledgeable in
optimizing recognition systems for various environments, minimizing error rates and integration with real time systems.
    - Developing a system that can perform speaker diarization, that automatically identify and segment different speakers in
an audio recording.
    - This technique is commonly used in meetings, interviews, and media content to improve the clarity
of who is speaking when. Successfully achieved, Diarization Error Rate (DER) of less than **20**.

- #### Keyword Spotting for Indian Languages: (Sep 2022 - Mar 2023)
    - Developed a system to accurately detect predefined keywords in audio recordings of various Indian languages (Telugu,
Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Bengali) using Kaldi speech processing toolkit.

- #### Automatic Speech Recognition: (Apr 2022 - Sep 2022)
    - Worked on a robust speech recognition system for Indian (English, Telugu, Hindi) using the Kaldi toolkit.
